##  Description
An 8-bit register implemented using D flip-flops (master-slave) with tri-state buffer output. Designed for integration into an 8-bit computer system. Includes input enable, output enable, and reset control.


##  Features
- Rising-edge D flip-flop using latch pairs
- Tri-state output with read control
- Resettable synchronous operation
- Simulated Delay:
  - Pre-layout: 0.34 ns
  - Post-layout: 0.81 ns
